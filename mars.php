				<h2>Mars</h2>

				<p>It is impossible to know the answer to ”when was Mars discovered”. It is bright enough to be seen in the night
				sky without binoculars or a telescope and has been documented for at least 4,000 years.</p>

				<p>If you were to change the question a little to ”who first theorized that Mars was a planet”, then an answer can
				be found. Nicolaus Copernicus is the first astronomer to postulate that Mars and a few other bodies known at the
				time were planets. The heliocentric theory that he published in 1543 marked the first time that astronomers widely
				considered the possibility that the Sun was the center of the Solar System instead of the Earth.</p>

				<p>While no one knows who first discovered Mars, we do know who made many of the discoveries about the planet.
				It is known that Tycho Brahe, a Danish astronomer made accurate calculations of the position of Mars as early as 1576.
				Johannes Kepler theorized that the orbit of Mars was elliptical in contradiction to what astronomers believed at the time.
				He soon expanded that theory to encompass all planets. In 1659, Christian Huygens, a Dutch astronomer drew Mars with the
				observations he made using a telescope he designed himself. He also discovered a strange feature on the planet that became
				known as Syrtis Major.</p>
